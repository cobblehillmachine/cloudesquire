					Effective November 1, 2010<br/><br/>

					The following terms reflect the agreement into which you have entered with Holocene Systems, LLC ('Holocene'), regarding your use of the services provided at the website with the URL address paralegaldatabase.com ('Website'):<br/><br/>

					1. Limited License &amp; Use of the Website<br/><br/>

					(1) The parties to this agreement are Holocene and you personally, or the partnership, corporation, association or other entity for which you are acting as agent and whose documents or materials are uploaded, stored and displayed as a result of your use of the Website ('Subscriber').  If the Subscriber is not a natural person, you represent and warrant to Holocene that you have the authority to enter into this agreement on its behalf.  Holocene grants to the Subscriber a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the Website.<br/>
					(2) Holocene does not review or claim intellectual property rights to the contents of electronic data uploaded or posted to the Website.<br/>
					(3) You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Website.<br/>
					(4) You agree not to modify, reverse engineer, adapt or otherwise tamper with the Website.<br/>
					(5) You agree not to use the Website in any manner which may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.<br/>
					(6) You agree not to use the Website to upload, post, host, or transmit unsolicited bulk e-mail 'Spam', short message service 'SMS' messages, viruses, self-replicating computer programs 'Worms' or any code of a destructive or malicious nature.<br/>
					(7) Except for the non-exclusive license granted pursuant to this agreement, you acknowledge and agree that all intellectual property rights in the Website remain solely with Holocene.<br/>
					(8) If your bandwidth usage exceeds 10 gigabytes per month, Holocene reserves the right to disable your subscription.  In the event that Holocene does disable your subscription, it will refund the portion of any payments made by the Subscriber for use of the Website, prorated to the number of days remaining prior to expiration.  Any such refund will be made to the person or entity who made the payment, even if that person is not the Subscriber.<br/>
					(9) Holocene reserves the right to modify or discontinue any feature associated with the Website without notice. Continued use of the Website following any modification constitutes the Subscriber's acceptance of the modification.<br/><br/>

					2. Access to the Website<br/><br/>

					(1) As part of the consideration Holocene will provide to the Subscriber as a result of this agreement, the Subscriber will be allowed to create no fewer than two user names for individuals ('Operators') to access and use the secured portions of the Website.  The Subscriber can add more Operators as necessary, but doing so will result in an increased charge the next time the subscription is renewed.  An Operator logging in to the Website may be required to provide his or her full legal name, a valid email address, a phone number and a mailing address.<br/>
					(2) Each Operator who logs in to the Website will be required to provide a user name that is not used by any other Operator associated with the Subscriber.  The user name will be used by one operator only and will not be shared with or used by any other person.<br/>
					(3) The Subscriber agrees to designate at least one Operator as an administrator ('Firm Manager').  A Firm Manager can create or delete other Operators, change their passwords and restrict or grant access to all materials stored for the Subscriber on the Website.  Further, a Firm Manager can designate other Operators as Firm Managers and remove the Firm Manager designation from other Operators.  The Subscriber agrees, understands and accepts that Holocene will not be liable to the Subscriber or any Operator in the event that a Firm Manager wrongfully restricts or grants access of other Operators to materials stored on the Website.<br/><br/>  

					3. Security of Passwords<br/><br/>

					(1) The Subscriber agrees to ensure that Operators will be responsible for protecting the security of their passwords as well as for the accuracy and adequacy of personal information provided to Holocene.<br/>
					(2) The Subscriber agrees to implement policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized use of Operator names or passwords.  The Subscriber further agrees to notify Holocene immediately upon suspicion that an Operator name or password has been lost, stolen, compromised, or misused.<br/>

					(1) The Subscriber agrees to pay for access to the Website with a valid Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Paypal credit card on a monthly basis through the subscription page on the Website.<br/>
					(2) The Subscriber agrees that it will receive the first month of access to the Website free of charge, but that the subscription will no longer be valid after that time unless payment is made pursuant to this agreement.  The Subscriber agrees that the fee for access to the Website is $7.99 per month per user, minimum of two users.  The Subscriber agrees that the total amount due will be subject to sales tax where appropriate.  The Subscriber understands and accepts that no refunds will be made unless Holocene elects to terminate the subscription in accordance with this agreement.<br/>
					(3) No refunds or credits will be issued for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an active subscription.<br/>
					(4) All prices are subject to change upon notice. Such notice may be provided by an e-mail message to a Firm Manager, or in the form of an announcement on the Website.  Holocene agrees that any increase in price will not be applied until the next time the subscription is renewed.  Subscriber agrees that no prepayment of subscription fees will be accepted for periods in excess of 60 days from the date payment is tendered.<br/><br/>

					5. Cancellation and Termination<br/><br/>

					(1) In the event that the Subscriber elects to cancel the subscription, it agrees to do so by causing all of its materials to be deleted from its account by means of the features made available for deletion on the Website.<br/>
					(2) Subscriber agrees that in the event that it fails to pay the subscription fee for a period of sixty days, Holocene may elect to treat such failure as a breach of this agreement or a cancellation of the subscription or both.  In such event, the Subscriber understands and accepts that Holocene may, in its sole discretion, permanently remove all materials associated with the Subscriber from all records maintained by Holocene pursuant to its operation of the Website.<br/>
